PYTHON PROBLEM STATEMENTS:
1.Fermat’s last theorem, also called Fermat’s great theorem, the statement that there are no natural numbers 
(1, 2, 3,…) x, y, and z such that x**n + y**n = z**n, in which n is a natural number greater than 2. For example, if
n = 3, Fermat’s last theorem states that no natural numbers x, y, and z exist such that x3 + y 3 = z3 
(i.e., the sum of two cubes is not a cube).
Input:
a=2
b=3
c=4
n=3
Output:
No that doesn't

(EXAMPLE)
TURN 1
Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 4
Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 6
Roll or hold? (r/h): r

Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 5
Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 4
Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 1
Turn over. No score.

TURN 3
Roll or hold? (r/h): r
Die: 2
